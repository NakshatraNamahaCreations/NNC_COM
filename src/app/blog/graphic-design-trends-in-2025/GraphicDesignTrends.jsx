                  Simple design is still in, but it’s changing. Now, instead of
                  just clear backdrops and simple pictures, 2025’s simple style
                  has fun twists—bright colors, cool fonts, and hand-made bits.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  The goal is to keep it easy but add a bit of you. Think neat
                  plans with a dash of human touch. For instance, companies are
                  mixing white spaces with rough lines, wavy art, or moving
                  logos that change when you point at them. This style is great
                  for businesses that want to look new but still warm and
                  friendly.

                  By 2025, the old ways mix with new ones in design. Think
                  bright, neon colors, early 2000s vibes, simple pixel art with
                  shiny, 3D bits, and bold visuals with space-age fonts.

                  This blend of past and present isn't just nice to see — it has

                  like DALL·E, MidJourney, or Adobe Firefly to try out styles,
                  then add feeling and stories to their work. for brands, this

                  By 2025, words are not just read—they are seen. The style of
                  writing has changed from just text to the main show. We now
                  see big fonts, moving text, and odd shapes of letters.

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Big fonts are not only about size—they show a strong feel.
                  They can be made tall, mixed with different feels, or made to
                  move as you scroll. Now, fonts show feelings by themselves.
                  For a brand's look, the right style of writing can say a
                  lot—both in sound and sight.

                  Stock photos are now old. People want real things, and nothing
