                    What is Web Development?
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Web development is the work involved in creating and
                    maintaining websites (and other web-related solutions such
                    as web applications). The terminology web development can
                    refer to the actions of designing, developing, testing, and
                    implementing web-based solutions. The whole process of
                    creating a website or web application is referred to as web
                    development. In summary, it refers to turning ideas into
                    useful web experiences. Design is important, but it is only
                    part of the process. Web developers build structure and
                    functionality for a website in code. Without code, the
                    website would remain static without functionality or
                    interaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Picture a website as a house. Design would be the
                    architectural plan, or how the rooms are situated and
                    appear. Web development would be the actual building of it.
                    The builder has to make certain the walls stand, the
                    plumbing works, and the lights turn on. There are various
                    tools to accomplish different things. HTML creates the basic
                    structure, CSS makes it look great, and JavaScript adds
                    functionality. There are also other components that include
                    CMS websites, React JS, Node JS. The process of web
                    development sometimes feels like a never ending learning
                    process to stay on top of how technology is constantly
                    changing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Web development can range from simple to complex, with
                    everything from a simple personal website to a large scale
                    e-commerce web site. It's a technical and creative field and
                    keeps the internet alive!

                  <p>
                    The phase of design is the work of visualizing the website's
                    layout and user interface (UI) and includes creating the
                    overall look and feel, color strategies, typography,
                    imagery, etc. The design must be user-friendly, attractive,
                    and effectively convey the brand. Nakshatra Namaha Creations
                    is one of the best Web Development Agencies in Bangalore and

                  <p>
                    Development is the technical aspect of creating the website;
                    which is everything from coding and programming. The
                    development process has two specific builds: front-end
                    development (the portion the user interacts with) and
                    back-end development (the parts of it taking place on the
                    server side or database). Nakshatra Namaha Creations's Web
                    Development Services in Bangalore include both front-end and

                    images, videos, and other media that will appear on the web
                    site. Quality content is important to keep visitors engaged,

                  <p>
                    Testing and QA are vital parts of checking the website to
                    ensure there are no bugs or compatibility problems or
                    usability issues. You want the site to perform well when it

                    initial requirement stated or agreed upon. Nakshatra Namaha

                  <p>
                    Deployment is the point at which a website is made live and
                    public-facing. This includes configuring the hosting
                    services, uploading the necessary files, and adjusting the

                    keeping it secure, updated, and working properly. A website
                    should always be updated, fixed, and improved upon.
