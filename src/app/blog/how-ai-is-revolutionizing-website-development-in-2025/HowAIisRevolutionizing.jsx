By 2025, making web sites is changing a lot. It's not just about new code or systems, but how big of a part AI is now playing. AI tools have grown past just being nice extras; they are now key parts of what web creators, artists, and online firms use every day. AI helps do the same work over and over, and helps in making smart design picks. It is making work flows quick and pushing the limits of what we can do on the web. The aim is not to cut out the web makers, but to help them and speed up their work—making everything quicker, working well, and full of new ideas.
