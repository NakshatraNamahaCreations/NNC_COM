                                    Choosing between a custom website and a template depends on your business needs, budget, and future plans. Templates offer a cost-effective and quick solution suitable for many businesses. Custom websites provide flexibility, uniqueness, and scalability but require more time and investment. Evaluate your goals carefully, and select the option that aligns best with your brand and resources. Either way, a well-designed website can help you reach and engage your customers effectively.
