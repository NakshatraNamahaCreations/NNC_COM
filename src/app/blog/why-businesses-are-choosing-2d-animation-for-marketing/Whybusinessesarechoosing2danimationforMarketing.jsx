                                    2D animation is a creative technique that brings drawings, characters and objects to life in a two-dimensional space. It focuses on creating movement using flat designs that have height and width but lack depth, making them appear visually simple yet engaging. This form of animation is achieved by sequencing individual frames, where each frame is a slight variation from the previous one, resulting in smooth and fluid motion when played together.  <br /><br />

                                    Widely used in cartoons, explainer videos, advertisements and educational content, 2D animation is valued for its clarity and versatility. Its ability to simplify complex ideas and present them in an appealing way makes it an ideal choice for storytelling and marketing across various industries.

                                       While 2D animation works well for many industries, it may not be suitable for showcasing intricate or detailed products.
