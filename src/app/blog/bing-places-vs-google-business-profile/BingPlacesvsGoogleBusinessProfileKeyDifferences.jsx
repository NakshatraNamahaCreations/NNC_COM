                When it comes to managing your business's online presence, most
                people think of Google. But Bing, Microsoft’s search engine,
                also offers tools for businesses to appear in search results.
                While both Bing Places and Google Business Profile (GBP) offer
                similar goals — increasing visibility and managing business
                listings — they work a little differently.

                  What is Bing Places?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Bing Places is Microsoft’s free business listing platform that
                  helps local businesses appear in Bing search results and Bing
                  Maps. It's similar in function to Google Business Profile but
                  tailored to Bing’s user ecosystem. Businesses can claim or add
                  their listings, upload photos, add operating hours, and even
                  manage multiple locations.

                  Both platforms allow you to list your business at no cost.
                  Whether you're a small shop or a multi-location brand, setting
                  up an account and adding your business details won’t cost you
                  anything.

                  Once listed, your business can appear on respective platforms
                  — Google Maps for GBP and Bing Maps for Bing Places — as well
                  as in local search results when someone searches for

                  local SEO rankings.

                  Yes — and here’s why:. <br /> <br />
                  <a href="https://g.co/kgs/ciWdaVN">Google Business</a> Profile
                  is non-negotiable for any local business aiming to appear in
                  Google Search and Maps. <br /> <br />
                  Bing Places is worth the extra effort for broader reach and

                  If you're a local business looking to build trust and
                  visibility online, you shouldn’t overlook either platform.
                  While Google Business Profile is the heavyweight in this
                  space, Bing Places gives you access to a different slice of
                  the internet — one that's still used by millions. Managing
                  both listings ensures your customers can find you, no matter
                  where they search.
