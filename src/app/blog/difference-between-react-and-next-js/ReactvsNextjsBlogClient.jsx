                  What is Next JS?
                </h2>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Next.js is a React-based framework developed by Vercel. It
                  takes the powerful core of React and adds a suite of features
                  that make building server-rendered and static websites a
                  breeze. With Next.js, you can build fast, SEO-friendly
                  applications with minimal configuration.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  One of the biggest advantages of Next.js is its built-in
                  support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site
                  Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
                  These rendering methods allow developers to optimize
                  performance and improve the user experience. Additionally,
                  Next.js offers API routes, which enable you to create backend
                  endpoints directly within your application, making it an
                  excellent choice for full-stack development.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Another feature that sets Next.js apart is its powerful
                  routing system. Instead of manually setting up routes as you
                  would in plain React, Next.js uses a file-based routing
                  system. This approach automatically generates routes based on
                  the file structure of your project, making development faster
                  and more organized
                </p>

              <div id="react">

                  What is React?
                </h2>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  React is an open-source JavaScript library maintained by Meta
                  (formerly Facebook) and a large community of developers. It is
                  not a full-fledged framework like Next.js but rather a
                  component- based library that helps you build user interfaces
                  (UIs), primarily for single-page applications (SPAs).
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  React provides a lot of flexibility and control over your
                  project. It allows you to manage the state and props of
                  components efficiently, which is crucial for building dynamic
                  and interactive UIs. With React, developers can create
                  reusable UI components, leading to cleaner and more
                  maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  However, the flexibility of React comes at a cost. Unlike
                  Next.js, React does not include built-in features for routing,
                  server-side rendering, or API handling. You need to integrate
                  additional libraries such as React Router, Redux, or Axios to
                  achieve a full-stack application experience. While this might
                  seem like extra work, it also gives developers the freedom to
                  customize their tech stack according to their projectâ€™s needs.

                  Is Next JS Better Than React?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The answer to whether Next.js is better than React depends on
                  your project requirements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you need SEO-friendly pages, server-side rendering and
                    fast performance, Next.js might be the better choice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you're building a single-page application with highly
                    interactive UIs and want full control over your tech stack,
                    React might be more suitable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next.js essentially builds on top of React, offering
                    additional features and pre-configurations. It could be seen
                    as a supercharged version of React for projects where
                    server-side rendering and SEO matter.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  When deciding between React and Next.js in 2025, consider the
                  following scenarios:
                </p>
                <p>Choose Next.js if:</p>

                  <li>
                    You are building a static website, e-commerce site, or a
                    blog.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You want to use server-side rendering or static site
                    generation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You prefer having a full-stack framework with API routes.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Choose React if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You are developing a single-page application with dynamic

                  <li>

                    libraries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your application does not require server-side rendering.
                  </li>

                    You prefer having a full-stack framework with API routes.

                In 2025, with the web development landscape evolving rapidly,
                Next.js is expected to gain even more traction due to its
                all-in-one nature. However, React will continue to hold its
                ground as a powerful UI library, especially for dynamic and
                interactive applications.

                  Both React and Next.js are fantastic tools for building modern
                  web applications. Your choice should be guided by your
                  projectâ€™s needs, development experience and business goals.

                  If you are looking for a quick, SEO-friendly and full-stack
                  solution, Next.js might be your go-to framework. However, if
                  you want flexibility, customization and are primarily building
                  a dynamic single-page application, then React is a strong
                  contender.

                  Ultimately, both technologies complement each other and having
